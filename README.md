# Audio Classification using 1D CNN and Transformer Encoder

In this project we have done a comparative analysis of the performance of a **Vanilla 1D CNN** and a **transformer encoder** in classification task of environmental audio samples.
The dataset contained 400 audio samples divided into 10 classes which were used for training, testing and validation purposes.

## Objective:

The main objective of this project was to get familiarised with the encoder part of the transformer architecture and concepts like multihead self-attention mechanism, embedding, layer normalization etc.
